    An HTML comment starts with a <! -- tag and ends with a --> tag.
        These tags tell the browser that the text inside them should not be rendered on the front end.
        Comments allow you to leave notes in your code for yourself or another developer, or to temporarily deactivate
        sections of code for debugging.

    HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau,
    and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
    Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to
    another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
